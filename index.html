  <p>I don't know what to put here. I guess I'll put some random words. Tapestry. Tears. Joy. Cough medicine. Giraffe. Purse. Leaf. Chair. Crash. Practice. Laser. Peanut. Tart. Finance. Parent. Stool. Guitare. Calm. Saw. Teddy bear. Railway. Increments. Butter. Dolphin. Blanket.</p>
  <h3>Here, have some Eartha Kitt lyrics. (the song is called "I Wanna Be Evil.")</h3>
  <p>Like something that seeks it's level
I wanna go to the devil.

I wanna be evil, I wanna spit tacks
I wanna be evil, and cheat at jacks 
I wanna be wicked, I wanna tell lies
I wanna be mean, and throw mud pies

I want to wake up in the morning
with that dark brown taste
I want to see some dissipation in my face 
I wanna be evil, I wanna be mad
But more that that I wanna be bad

I wanna be evil, and trump an ace, 
Just to see my partner's face.
I wanna be nasty, I wanna be cruel
I wanna be daring, I wanna shoot pool

And in the theatre 
I want to change my seat
Just so I can step on 
Everybody's feet

I wanna be evil, I wanna hurt flies 
I wanna sing songs like the guy who cries
I wanna be horrid, I wanna drink booze
(I want to be horrid, I want to make news)*
And whatever I've got I'm eager to lose

I wanna be evil, little evil me
Just as mean and evil as I can be
